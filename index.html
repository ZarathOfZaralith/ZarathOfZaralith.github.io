		<h1> Day One </h1>
		<p>What the fuck?! How did you find this site?! Ah well it doesn’t matter. Welcome to my blog! The affectionately named McDonalds of shitty ideas. Where brain cells come to die! All kinds of articles can be found in the shady halls of this internet road trip fast food stop! From hentai to the trap-no state, the grills of speculation and general retardation are always ready to serve you up a nice hot slab of “wtf” between some lukewarm buns. 
So check out the menu and enjoy your stay. Like a school bus where the children are the body of the bus itself (#sewingClasses) spending to much time will probably do some damage! Lets get started:</p>
<p>	TODAYS UNPOPULAR OPINION:</p>

<p>The human mind is at its core a simple observer in complex system that is its mind in which it has little control! That’s right I said it you filthy monkeys. I believe that your thoughts and emotions are happening to you and are not caused by any free will you got. The conclusion I have come to is that the realest expression of the human mind is in pure observation and comparison. The outcome of these observations is not the product of a special spiritual choice you get to make. You may despise this all you want! You can hate it! You can go to the necropolis under Paris and wank your pee pee off to the skulls of the dead over it while you lament your shitty existence. None of that however will ever change it if its right. </p>
<p>The reason I believe this is because everything I have ever seen my whole life has been the subject of cause and effect. You drop the ball and it falls every time. Why would this cause and effect suddenly form a big bubble of magic around our choices? I doubt and am skeptical it would. Chances are your environment, your habits, and the laws of physics are your fucking GOD! The sooner you realize this the sooner shit gets better because you start making real changes and imposing on the environment to support yourself. Which your gonna do regardless because if its right then there is only one real conclusion you can come to any ways because you evolved to survive.</p>

<p>Amazing how common sense that shit is. The worst part about it however to the un-educated like my self is the fucking horrifying entropy of human society by this fucking mechanism. The idiotic will only grow more idiotic so long as their idiocy is not met with a fucking show of force the likes of which would fucking make it clear that they are retard. The smart will grow smarter and the divide will only grow. So what’s the answer as the population stratifies and tribes form? </p>
<p>No clue.</p>
<p>	I aren’t no messiah, fuck I am probably not even educated enough to understand the opinions I say I espouse. What I do know though is beating the ever-loving Christ out of the blatantly idiotic isn’t an option. Thanks to the miracle of evolution we are mostly capable of just barely surviving this purposeless hellscape. We are also really good at killing each other to do it.  Thanks to evolution we have the capacity for moral thought and the most common moral to survive out of all the morals we have dreamed up is that people ought to survive. </p>
<p>	I am not getting my ass beat gang style in the self-righteous hope that my genocidal bullshit will make the world better for those who know how to fucking do math.</p>
<p>	So whats the answer? (The persistent fuck may ask)</p>
<p>	Well quite simply we got to explain over and over again to the rejects of this world that they are not better than the laws of reality. We need to impart on all those we raise and nurture that shit is rough and will get rougher if you’re a dumbass. We need to get people skeptical and get them respecting themselves so they actually hold themselves to an intellectual standard. Unfortunately, just being able to hold down a job won’t cut it because we are starting to encounter issues that require an intellectually responsible population. Hence why this site was made. I am gonna start my own personal shit crusade to hunt down and do my part to reduce idiocy. I am hoping we can go on an adventure from dipshit to the legit shit!<p>

<p>Now before I end this article I am gonna introduce a fundamental moral of this site. NONE OF THIS IS FACTS IF I DON’T PROVE IT WITH EVIDENCE! These are opinions, just so we’re clear for the degenerate dipshits who wander the internet thinking shit is the truth. Fucking 2018 and I have to throw that one out there because apparently like 90% of us are mentally retarded children with jobs.  Remember Skepticism kids! </p><p> -Love Zarath</p>
